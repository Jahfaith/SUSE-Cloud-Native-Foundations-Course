GitHub Actions

The following folder/directory and files are needed:
1. create a folder for the project on your local machine eg python-helloworld.
2. create a repo on github with the same name as the project folder on your local machine.
3. in the project folder on your local machine, create the following:
a. mkdir -p .github/workflows (Using GitBash) or .github>>workflows (create the first folder, then create the second folder inside the first folder).
b. docker-build.yml file in .github/workflows
c. app.py
d. requirements.txt
e. Dockerfile

Once these files are complete,
1. push the project folder (python-helloworld) consisting of the other folders and files to the github repo you created earlier.
2. ensure your docker image is running. go to your dockerhub to ensure that.
3. on your github repo for the project, go to SETTINGS, SECRETS, new-repository-secret -specify your dockerhub username, save it, then specify your password, save it.
4. make a commit eg edit a readme.
5. go to Actions (At the top where you have Settings, Repositories, Insight etc) and you will see the Actions running.

5a. If an error is thrown, read the error message and trace the file.
5b. sometimes, you may need to edit some parameters in your docker-build.yml file.
